# Plaza as Industry

A small 1x1 dummy industry which does nothing but spawn farm fields. It also blends in with the farm scenery and generates a small amount of passengers.

If you love fields and the industry set of your choice doesn't produce enough of them, just place these instead of meticulously placing NewObject fields.

- Compatible with all industry sets
- Uses baseset farm sprites
- Select whether to create fields when generating a map
